# Hello Charts
**Say hello to better charts for WordPress**

Hello charts is a WordPress plugin that makes it super easy to add data rich charts to your WordPress pages and posts.
The plugin is designed and built to be "block editor first", so that your chart creation experience lives right within your native WordPress content creation flow.

## Multiple Chart Types

Content creators can choose from four different chart types, right from within the block editor. These chart types are:

- Pie chart
- Bar (and column) chart
- Line chart
- Radio chart

## Easy Data Entry

Editing your chart's data is a breeze! Simply click the Edit Data button, and work within a very familiar spreadsheet / table style interface. Add rows and columns to easily fine-tune your datasets and create easy-to-understand visualisations for your readers.
